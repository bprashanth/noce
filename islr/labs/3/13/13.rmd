Create some simulated data and fit simple linear regression models to it. 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

## a. b. c. Using rnorm() create a vector x with 100 obs from N(mean = 0, sd = 1). This represents a feature X.

```{r}
x = rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1) # mean 0 and sd 1 is the default 
eps = rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=0.25^0.5) # var 0.25 => sd sqrt(0.25)
y = -1 + 0.5 * x + eps
```

* What is the length of the vector `y`? 100
* What are the values of `B_0` and `B_1` in this linear model? -1, 0.5

## d. Create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between `x` and `y`. Comment. 

```{r}
plot(x, y)
```

There is a highly linear relationship between x and y, with a positive, upward slope. 

## e. Fit a least squares model to predict y given x. 

```{r}
lm.y_fit = lm(y~x)
summary(lm.y_fit)
```

* How do the estimated `Bs` compare to the actual `Bs`

They're very close because the true distribution is normal.
